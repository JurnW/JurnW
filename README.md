### I’m Jurn, a designer who codes
I am a (remote) freelance designer and front-end developer with 6 years experience working for startups to publicly traded multinationals and companies in between.

Whenever I'm not working with clients I work on my own products and side-projects such as [Screely](https://screely.com) and [VloggingPro](https://vloggingpro.com) (sold)

If you'd like help with your next project, shoot me an email at hello@jurn.io

### Writing
I enjoy writing and regularly publish guest posts whenever I'm not writing for my own blog
