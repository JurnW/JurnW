## I’m Jurn, a designer who codes

I am a (remote) freelance designer and front-end developer. Apart from client work I also work on my own projects such as [Screely](https://screely.com), [QuestionJar](https://www.questionjar.com) and [VloggingPro](https://vloggingpro.com) (acq'd)

If you'd like help with your next project, shoot me an email at contact@jurn.io
